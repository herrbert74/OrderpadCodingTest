# Feedback

When asking about the use of Thread in VH, we would liked to of understood a bit more from you on your understanding of the technology.

When given the issue of !! In the code this error was not spotted.

With some of the issues that were spotted we would have liked some more details around how they could be amended.

We would have liked an understanding as to why you follow clean architecture however this was not given in interview.

Would have liked knowledge around creating network layers.

The team thought there was also some great elements to the interview too with the errors you did spot you were able to provide solutions which worked really effectively. 

# My response

I haven't responded because the reasons felt fabricated.

A double bang was actually spotted and removed, just not the second one for some reason. It's something 
that easy to miss during an interview, obviously not the lack of knowledge, because there was an identical fix.

I explained the network layer, not sure what was missing, but I'm sure that I'd do it properly.

I do not remember any clarification questions on the other issues, apart from the ViewHolder, where I did have some 
vagueness. I haven't touched ViewHolders for almost a year now.
